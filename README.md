Zoo Management System

A comprehensive Zoo Management System implemented in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This project showcases all four pillars of OOP: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. It features complex logic structures such as arrays of pointers (Animal* animals[MAX_ANIMALS];), enabling efficient dynamic memory management and polymorphic behavior.

Key Features:
Encapsulation: Data hiding with private attributes and public methods for controlled access.
Abstraction: Simplified animal behaviors through abstract base classes.
Inheritance: Hierarchical classification of animals (e.g., Mammal, Reptile, Bird).
Polymorphism: Runtime method overriding for diverse animal behaviors using virtual functions.
Array of Pointers: Efficient handling of a dynamic collection of animals for better flexibility and memory management.
